1. To avoid overwriting the output, please code here 

2. what is the remainder if 9 is divided by 2. Is 9 even?

3. Convert the string "s = 'i am in Alberta'" into upper case and into a list.
s = 'i am in Alberta'â€‹

4. Convert the string "s = 'My name is #Qazi!'" *into lower case and split at # into a list. *

5. We have

province = "Alberta"
population = 4.1
** print the following using format()**

The total population of Alberta is 4.1 million.
Steps:
Create place holders inside the string in the print statement.
pass in the initialized variables to the format to fill the place holders

province = "Alberta"
population = 4.1

6. Can you grab "Canada" from the nested list? Use indexing.
a = ['Alberta',2,[3,4],[5,['Canada',7,['hello']],10,15],1,7]


7. List name of provinces (keys) from the dictionary below.
d = {'BC':'Victoria','AB':'Edmonton', 'ON':'Toronto', 'QC':'Quebec City'}

8. From the nested dictionary, grab the word "Montreal". Little tricky! *
d = {'k1':'AB','k2':[1,{'BC':['SK','ON','Vancouver',{'Calgary':[1,2,3,'Montreal']}]}]}

*9. What is the main difference between a tuple and a list? *

10. An element can appear multiple times in a set ? True / False

11. You got email addresses, write a function to split the website domain *
user_name@some_domain.ca    
passing email and the function should return some_domain.com

12. Can you write a function that tells you if there is a word 'Calgary' in the provided string?
How to deal if the word "city" is capitalized? *

Create a function
Pass the string 's' to the function
in order to account for the capitalization, we will use .lower and split at white space

13. Write a function to return square of numbers from 1 to 5, use range() method *

14. Write lambda expression for the function above, use map() and range()

15. filter the words from a list that start with 'c'. Use lambda expression and filter().

veg_list = ['tomato','cabbage','meat','chicken','goat']
*Out put should be *

['cabbage','chicken']

veg_list = ['tomato','cabbage','meat','chicken','goat']

more than 100 CAD, you get 40 % discounts, 
Its Monday, and you are spending more than 50 CAD, you get a cherry on top! 10 CAD OFF
write a function to calculate how much the customer will pay for any spending.
Tricky? 
You need to develop the logic! 
Take a pen and a notebook and do the calculations if needed!
test the function for [51,50,100,101] using for loop with you function

Good Luck**
